# Microverse Week 2 HTML/CSS project

The Nextwebpage is replicated using HTML and CSS language. It is using several techniques for achieving the
layout such as sticky top nav, flexbox, css grid and media queries. It is using a lot of custom fonts taken from original webpage plus all
of the assets are either taken from website or found on google image search. Most of the website is using css-grid for achieving
the tablet and mobile layout. Where css-grid could not do the job we used media queries to assist in achieving the final result.
We believe that media queries should be avoided where it is possible to do so. Using CSS Grid and flexbox can massively help to achieve
the desired layout without media queries and in addition it helps to save time, clutter and precious repeated lines of code.
